=head1 NAME

Method::Misspelt - allow for misspelled method calls

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Method::Misspelt;
class Foo does Method::Misspelt {
    method foo-bar() { "foobar" }
}
say Foo.foo_bar;  # foobar

class Bar does Method::Misspelt[:mangler(*.lc)] {
    method foo-baz() { "foobaz" }
}
say Bar.FOO-baz;  # foobaz

say Bar.misspelt;  # Map.new((FOO-baz => foo-baz))

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Method::Misspelt> distribution provides a C<Method::Misspelt> role
that allows a class to efficiently allow for non-existing methods being
called that could be considered a misspelling of another method in that
class.

It is only partly serious: it serves mostly as an example of what is
possible with a L<C<FALLBACK> method|https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Fallback_method>
in a class.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 FALLBACK

The C<Method::Misspelt> role provides a C<FALLBACK> method.  If your
class provides its own C<FALLBACK> method, then the one from the role
will be ignored.

=head2 misspelt

The C<misspelt> method returns a C<Map> with the mapping of the misspelt
method name and the name of the method that was actually called.
